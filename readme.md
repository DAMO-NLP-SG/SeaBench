This repository contains evaluation code for SeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. Specifically, SeaBench evaluates models' multi-turn and instruction-following abilities across Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese languages through carefully crafted evaluation tasks.

# Data
All the data is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SeaLLMs/SeaBench). Currently, only `public-questions.jsonl` here (private questions are hidden to avoid data contamination).

Please also check SeaExam dataset [here](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaExam) for more evaluation tasks on SEA languages.

# Evaluation
## Setup enironment
```
git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaBench.git
cd SeaBench
conda create -n SeaBench python=3.9
conda activate SeaBench
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## 1. run inference to get model's prediction
You need to first generate model's response, you can directly run `python gen_responses.py`.
It supports both open-source or commercial models. 

Example:
```
python gen_responses.py --model_id SeaLLMs/SeaLLMs-v3-7B-Chat
```

Please pay attention to:
* different models have different ways to express `system_prompt`, `user_turn`, and `assistant_turn`
* it needs to at least support a two-turn inference

Either way, the model prediction would be in `./outputs/{model_name}.jsonl`
* It should add two keys for each row compared to `publuc-questions.jsonl`: modelname_1 and modelname_2, which are the model's responses at the 1st and 2nd turn

## 2. judge model evaluation
Specify openai API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx`, then run `python gen_judgements.py --testing_model model_name`
* by default, it will use gpt-4o-2024-08-06 as the evaluator
* the predictions will be written to `./model_judgement/` directory

## 3. extract and summarize the results
run `python gen_results.py` will give the results of a certain model

## Pipeline
You can also specify the testing_model, judge_model and OPENAI_API_KEY in pipeline.sh and quickly run
```
source pipeline.sh
```

# Leaderboard
You can find our interactive leaderboard [ðŸ¤— Here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SeaLLMs/SeaExam_leaderboard). The leaderboard showcases results from two complementary benchmarks: [SeaExam](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaExam) and [SeaBench](https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaBench). Each benchmark evaluates different aspects of model capabilities through distinct question types, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
